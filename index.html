  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I’m a Software Engineer with 4 years of experience building reliable backend systems, 
scalable APIs, and fast, intuitive web apps. I work mainly with Node.js, TypeScript, React, 
PostgreSQL, and AWS, with a strong focus on performance, clean architecture, and automation. 
Across roles at ANR Software and other tech teams, I’ve consistently improved system speed, 
reduced errors, optimized cloud costs, and strengthened CI/CD pipelines. I enjoy solving real 
engineering problems and helping teams ship better and faster. Recently completed my Master’s 
in Computer Science at Clark University (December 2025) and always open to connecting with 
teams building scalable platforms or modern applications.
